# [Wyze Bulb, Switch, Sensor and Lock Integration](https://github.com/JoshuaMulliken/ha-wyzeapi) for Home Assistant

This is a custom component to allow control of Wyze Bulbs, Switches, Sensors, and Locks in Home Assistant using the unofficial Wyze API. Please note this mimics the Wyze app and therefore Wyze may cut off access at anytime.

### Highlights of what **WyzeApi** can do

* Control Wyze Bulbs as lights through HA
* Control Wyze Switches as switches through HA
* View Wyze Sensors as binary_sensor through HA
* View Wyze Lock Status and Door Status as lock through HA
	* ***Note:* Currently you can only view the lock status or door status. Lock and Unlock does not work!**
